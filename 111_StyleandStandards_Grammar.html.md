  <td>
  <p>colon (:) vs. semicolon (;)</p>
  </td>
  <td>
<p>Use colons and semicolons sparingly. Use the colon ( : ) to introduce a list of things. The items after a colon are not complete sentences by themselves. The semicolon ( ; ) separates two distinct clauses within one sentence. The phrase after a semicolon is a complete sentence.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>If the sentence needs a colon but does not need a bulleted list, consider rewriting the sentence to avoid using a colon. </li>
				<li>If the sentence has a semicolon, try to separate it into two different sentences, or find a cleaner way to combine them into one sentence.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>See the examples for ways to write the same sentence with and without a colon or semicolon. The preferred method for such a sentence is without a colon or semicolon.</p>

  <td>
  <p>imperative mood</p>
  </td>
  <td>
  <p>Use the imperative mood to write instructional documentation such as procedures and tutorials. The imperative mood tells the reader, directly, to do something. Other moods can imply optional behavior when you might not intend to present an action as optional. </p>
  <p>For example, in instructions for uploading documents, clicking <b>Upload</b> is not a suggested, optional action. If the document provides instructions for how to upload documents, assume the readers wants to perform that action. Do not use language such as, "If you want to upload a document, you can click <b>Upload</b>" or, "By clicking <b>Upload</b>, you can choose how many documents you want to upload." Instead write, "Click <b>Upload</b> and select one or more documents."</p>

  <td>
  <p>tenses: present, future, and conditional</p>
  </td>
  <td>
  <p>Use present tense. In technical writing, present tense is easier to read than past or future tense. Simple verbs are easier to read and understand than complex verbs, such as verbs in the progressive or perfect tense.</p>
  <p>The more concise and straightforward you can be, the better.</p>
